USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.  I WILL NOT PROVIDE ANY SUPPORT OF THIS CONTRACT.

Notes:
1. Make sure the contract is set to "Inject Web3"
2. Make sure MetaMask is connected and the wallet balances are the same
3. Hit deploy to create the new funding address (the one you will use in the Etho Node Dashboard)
4. Make sure you save the contract address so you can interact with the contract later -- as in RECOVER your deposit!
5. TEST TEST TEST to make sure it works, fund, send test payments, withdraw your deposit etc.  For example send 101 ETHO to the contract address, check balance. Then send 1 ETHO from another wallet to the contract address.  That 1 ETHO will be forwarded to wallet the deployed the contract.  Then  withdraw check, to remove the 101 ETHO back to the deploy wallet.
